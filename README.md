# BG3_ModdingTool
BG3 Modding Tool is a C++ based GUI app that allows for easier and more convenient modifying of Baldur's Gate 3 files in order to make your own mods. 

Changelog:
v.0.2: 
  - the app correctly read and outputs files: Progressions.lsx and ClassDescriptions.lsx
  - boosts from Progressions are displayed in a table and editing them changes the output (but still needs polishing)
